# Raspberry Pi Music Player

This is a personal project to create an extension to the omxplayer media player that randomly play all music files in a directory recursively.

It's writen in .net core so it's not compatible with rpi zero.


What it does right now:

* Executes Omx player with all music files in the specified directory in appsetting.json configuration file.

What's still missing:

* Web interface to add and remove files.
* Create custom playlists.
* Volume Control
* Play Next
* Some other stuff that I haven't think about yet.
